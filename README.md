# Restaurant-Management-System-COA-

## About the project-
In this project, we are going to use the 8086 Assembly system to make a program to manage the billing system of a Restaurant. 

A restaurant management system is a collective term for software that helps streamline food business operations. Namely, restaurants, bars, bakeries, cafes, cloud (dark, virtual, ghost) kitchens, food trucks, or delivery businesses.
It combines all things that are good about the traditional POS (Point of Sale) systems, with tools that manage your phone calls, takes table reservations, streamlines inventory management, handles billing, provides actionable analytics, and also help with marketing activities such as CRM, loyalty programs and building an online presence. It also works seamlessly with your existing restaurant technology systems.


## Assembly language 8086:
Assembly level programming is very important to low-level embedded system design and is used to access the processor instructions to manipulate hardware.  It is a most primitive machine-level language used to make efficient code that consumes fewer clock cycles and takes less memory as compared to the high-level programming language. It is a complete hardware-oriented programming language to write a program the programmer must be aware of embedded hardware.
